# Project Overview: Creating Forms with JavaScript
*This project will test your knowledge of parsing through an array of data and appending it to the DOM.*


## Creating a Form in HTML
HTML forms are an integral part of virtually every webapp on the web. They allow our applications to collect, update and delete information and are the principal way that users interact with databases and other server-side technologies. Without forms, we wouldn't have paid services, e-commerce, or social media. 

The vast majority of our interaction with the web and applications is through forms. Well made forms create a seamless and effective user experience because good forms ask the right questions and use the appropriate input controls to collect data.

A good form is a powerful data collection tool, but to get the most out of your forms, you need to understand the nature of the data being collected. A semantic approach to choosing which input controls to use will go a long way toward the creation of usable and functional web forms.

## How do forms work?
Forms contain a set of input controls that users can enter data into. Examples of input controls might be:

* A field where a user enters some text, like their name.
* Drop-downs that allow users to select from a set of predetermined values, e.g. "Select your state..."
* Checkboxes to select or de-select options, e.g. "Do you agree to our terms of service..."
* User clicks a "Submit" button
